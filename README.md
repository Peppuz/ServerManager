# Server Manager Bot

The meaning of this bot is interfacing CLI of a UNIX server to Telegram.

I centralized my online presence on to Pavel's messaging platform, I love Telegram and how it become the new IRC of the era.
I created this bot to execute scripts on my server at home, but the cool thing that I thought is that I don't have to open the SSH port. When I check the ssh access log a lot of indians try to brute force my Pi. I bet for mining and so..

## To-do:
- [ ] Menu
- [ ] Navigator assistant (cd ..)
- [ ] Inline Keyboard as Aliases

Thanks to all the guys from [Python-Telegram-Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) for the great work on the wrapper.
