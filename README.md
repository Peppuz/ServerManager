# Server Manager Bot

The meaning of this bot is interfacing CLI to Telegram messaging platform.

> I centralized my online presence on to Pavel's messaging platform, I love Telegram and it's amazing how it become the new IRC of the era.
I created this bot to execute scripts on my server at home or for logging. When I check the ssh access log a lot of indians try to brute force my Pi. I bet for mining and so.
So I needed something practical, no apps, improve security, write just few lines of code.

Thanks to all the guys from [Python-Telegram-Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) for the great work on the wrapper.
